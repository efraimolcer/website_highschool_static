				OUR KINDERGARTEN
			</h3>
		
			<p>
				During kindergarten education, we prepare children for primary school. 
				We teach them sharing, solidarity, socializing and working together. 
				The aim of preschool education is to arouse interest in learning in children and 
				to make the existing abilities of the child visible. We also work for this purpose. 
				During this period, we try to teach children as much as possible, as they have high 
				learning potential. We raise them in good physical conditions and an active social environment. 
				This way, they can become the future Einstein.

			<h3>
				OUR PRIMARY SCHOOL
			</h3>
		
			<p>
				In our primary school, we encourage our students to take responsibility for their learning, 
				to take responsibility for their behavior, to protect nature and to serve society. 
				We expect them to initiate meaningful and responsible actions as a result of their learning. 
				Participation in community service activities gives our students the skills of collaboration, 
				problem solving, conflict resolution, creative and critical thinking. 
				Accordingly, we include them in community service activities. As Demer Primary School, 
				we offer a learning environment without the time, place, age and limits of learning.

			<h3>
				OUR SECONDARY SCHOOL
			</h3>
		
			<p>
				We train students in line with the general objectives and principles of the 
				Ministry of Education. We raise individuals who have basic knowledge and skills, 
				can think critically and multidimensionally, have effective communication skills, 
				and are creative and inclined to teamwork. We train our students to be self-confident, 
				able to think freely, and success-oriented individuals, who form the basis of our education 
				system with love, respect, tolerance, success and science leadership. We create a unique 
				academic study program for the high school entrance exam. We have educational and social 
				activities for 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th grades. We have expert teachers in the field. 
				We are always with our students and valued parents.

			<h3>
				OUR HIGH SCHOOL
			</h3>
		
			<p>
				At Demer High School, our students are not only at the university; 
				We aim to provide basic knowledge that they can use lifelong. 
				In line with this goal, we work with our expert, experienced and talented teachers. 
				With our 20 years of education experience, we apply the curriculum in the most efficient way. 
				We ensure that all subjects are taught to all our students in the best possible way. 
				Our exam evaluations are created by analyzing all the students' results comprehensively. 
				In this way, we determine the subject deficiencies in students and create a study plan in this way.
